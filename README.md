# README

This is a refactor of an older website that I worked on. The Edamam Recipe API lost free support and the website look needs updating. 
I replaced Edamam with TheMealDB API which you can find [here](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php). Also here's a [link](https://github.com/dice43/internetCookbook) to the old github repo for the orignial website. 

# NOTE
**This is a work in progress and isn't currently a finished product.**
